About Me

I am a Technical Writer with experience translating complex technical concepts into clear, user-focused documentation. 4 years experience working for a high-level executive and 3 years experience in luxury tourism and project management.

**Relevant Background**

While I am a Junior Technical Writer, I have years of experience creating and managing content in the hospitality, home decor and insurance industries. I alsi have a background in translation, corpus linguistics, literature and education. This cross section of experiences has afforded me a multilingual approach to technical writing which has proven useful for explaining complex topics to a diverse audience.
